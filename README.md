# LocomotiveEngine_TEL_CPP
My small 3D engine for SDL2/OpenGl. *A work in progress. Made using SDL2, OpenGl, Assimp, and CMAKE!

To run, open main folder in VSCODE, open a terminal and run the CMakeLists.txt like so:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

Once it's built, just type *make* and TADA!

*Note, ensure you've got OpenGl,SDL2 and Assimp brew installed or manually installed on your computer*
